To The Moon is a simple reflex-based tapping game where you try to launch a rocket as high as possible by tapping at the right moment.
As the power bar fills, a well-timed tap gives you more distance.
After 5 rounds, your total distance becomes your final score.

This project is my first mobile game attempt built with Unity. I aimed to run the entire game loop in a single script.
